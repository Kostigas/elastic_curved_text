# ðŸŒ€ Elastic Curved Text (jQuery + GSAP)

This is a smooth, interactive marquee animation built using **jQuery** and **GSAP**, replicating and enhancing the behavior of the `CurvedLoop` component from React Bits. It scrolls repeated text along a dynamic SVG path â€” with a twist: you can **drag to control the curvature of the path** in real-time.
